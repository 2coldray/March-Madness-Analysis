# March-Madness-Analysis
   March Madness is the nickname for the NCCA Division I men and women basketball tournament played at the end of every basketball season. 
It has the nickname March Madness because there’s always a lot of hype, excitement, epic victories, crushing defeats and it’s very 
entertaining as it’s one of the most anticipated basketball events of every year. 
Only 68 teams make the tournament and each of these teams battle it in a win and advance style tournament until a champion is crowned. 
Fans get in on the “madness” by filling out brackets in an attempt to pick a perfect bracket, or at least better than their friends. 
Now that sports betting is becoming legal in the United States, a lot more is going to be at stake when watching tournament games than 
just picking a good bracket which means correctly picking who wins and loses each round. 
The better the bracket, the more money that could be won. I wanted to do this project to analyze what characteristics of teams matter 
when filling out a bracket. 
I wanted to find out which conferences send the most teams to the tournament and if that plays a role in how deep they go. 
I also wanted to see if the teams with the best stats go the farthest, or if being a 1 seed matters. 
The questions I seek to answer include: Which conferences sends the most teams to the tournament each year? 
Do 1 seeds have an advantage to win Tournament? What stats are most important to winning? 
What are stats like of teams that win the tournament? 
What’s a profile of the winning teams? Let’s see what I find.
